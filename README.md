## Project Overview

A compact, easy-to-read Python utility that checks a target host (domain or IPv4 address) for open TCP ports from a curated list of common service ports. This tool is built with the Python standard library (`socket`) and is intended for educational use, quick local diagnostics, and light-weight testing in development environments.

## Key Features

* Resolves hostnames to IPv4 addresses and gracefully handles DNS errors.
* Scans a configurable list of common TCP ports (FTP, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SMTP, etc.).
* Uses `connect_ex()` with a short timeout to determine reachability, avoiding unhandled exceptions on failed connections.
* Simple command-line interface with clear, colored-friendly status output (OPEN/CLOSED).
* Minimal dependencies ‚Äî works with the Python standard library only.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.7 or newer is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or copy the `port_scanner.py` file into your project directory.
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

No external packages are required.

---

## Usage

Run the scanner interactively from the command line:

```bash
python3 port_scanner.py
Enter target IP or domain: example.com
```

The script will resolve the hostname (if necessary) and attempt to connect to each port in the scanner's port list. Ports that accept a TCP connection are reported as `OPEN`; ports that do not are reported as `CLOSED`.

---

## Example Output

```
Enter target IP or domain: localhost

üîç Scanning target: localhost (127.0.0.1)

‚ùå Port 20 is CLOSED
‚ùå Port 21 is CLOSED
‚úÖ Port 22 is OPEN
‚ùå Port 23 is CLOSED
‚ùå Port 25 is CLOSED
‚ùå Port 53 is CLOSED
‚úÖ Port 80 is OPEN
‚ùå Port 110 is CLOSED
‚ùå Port 143 is CLOSED
‚ùå Port 443 is CLOSED
‚ùå Port 8080 is CLOSED
```

---

## Configuration

You can modify the `common_ports` list in `port_scanner.py` to add or remove ports. Typical ports included by default:

```python
common_ports = [20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 110, 143, 443, 8080]
```

For production or advanced use, consider accepting ports or ranges via command-line arguments and adding concurrency (see Roadmap).

---

## Limitations

* IPv4 only ‚Äî the script uses `socket.AF_INET` and `socket.gethostbyname()`.
* Small, fixed port list ‚Äî not a full-range scanner.
* `connect_ex()` does not reliably distinguish between `closed` and `filtered` (firewalled) ports.
* Single-threaded ‚Äî scanning a large number of ports will be slow.
* No banner grabbing or service fingerprinting ‚Äî the script only tests for TCP connection acceptance.

---

## Security & Legal

Network scanning can be considered intrusive. Only scan machines and networks that you own or have explicit authorization to test. Unauthorized scans may violate local laws or acceptable-use policies. Use this tool responsibly and ethically.

---

## Roadmap (Suggested Enhancements)

* Add IPv6 support using `socket.getaddrinfo()`.
* Accept port ranges and custom lists via `argparse`.
* Implement concurrency with `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` or `asyncio`.
* Add banner grabbing after successful connections to identify running services.
* Provide machine-readable output formats (JSON, CSV) for automation.
* Add unit tests and CI checks.
